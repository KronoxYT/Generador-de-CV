/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model. All user-specific data,
 * such as profiles, work experience, and skills, is nested under a path unique to that user's ID
 * (/users/{userId}). This ensures that users can only access and modify their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure: The data is organized into two main areas:
 * 1. User-Private Data: A top-level 'users' collection where each document represents a user.
 *    Subcollections for 'workExperiences', 'educations', 'skills', and 'cvTemplates' are nested
 *    under the corresponding user document, inheriting the ownership-based security.
 * 2. Public Data: A top-level 'templates' collection contains CV templates that are globally
 *    readable by all users but are not writable by clients, ensuring data integrity.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user's access is strictly confined to their document tree within /users/{userId}.
 *   They cannot read, write, or list data belonging to other users.
 * - No User Enumeration: Listing documents in the top-level '/users' collection is explicitly
 *   disallowed to prevent malicious actors from discovering the list of all users.
 * - Read-Only Public Data: The '/templates' collection is public for reading and listing but is
 *   locked down against all client write operations (create, update, delete). This content is
 *   expected to be managed by a trusted backend service using the Admin SDK.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, documents within a user's tree (e.g., a work experience)
 *   must contain a 'userProfileId' field that matches the user's ID from the path. This field is
 *   enforced as immutable to prevent documents from being "moved" between users.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization: The entire security model is built on path-based authorization.
 * By nesting a user's private collections under `/users/{userId}`, we can write fast and secure
 * rules like `isOwner(userId)` without needing slow and costly `get()` calls to other documents to
 * verify ownership.
 *
 * Structural Segregation: User data (private) and template data (public) are stored in separate
 * top-level collections. This is a secure and performant pattern that prevents accidental data
 * leakage and simplifies rules for list operations.
